    <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>This page is meant to serve as an outline of a super app meant to help someone travel.</p>
    <h1>The challenge of a travel super app</h1>
        <p>Travelling around the world can be a difficult task. There are many customs, rules and regulations that a user may not be aware of. This app is meant to help ease the process by providing information about the place you are travelling to, as well as, providing a single app that allows you to book, research, rent and prepare for any journey ahead of you.</p>
    <h1>Research Methods</h1>
        <p>A survey was conducted to find the 'pain-points' of common travel apps. It was found that users value an app that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keeps information all in one place</li>
            <li>Notifies the user if there are any changes to their vacation (via SMS or a notification)</li>
            <li>Responsive, intuitive and fluid experience</li>
        </ul>
    <h1>Personas</h1>
        <p>To help study the user experience of the app, the following two personas were made:</p>

        <img src="pics/ellie_persona.png" alt="Persona 2">
    <h1>User Journey</h1>
        <p>In order to help understand the persona, I created a user journey that takes them through researching a place to travel to.</p>

    <h1>Sketches</h1>
    <h1>Wireframes</h1>
    <h1>Color Palette</h1>
        <p>Below is the color palette of the app. I decided to use a mixture of green and blue since the colors complement each other and they also complement the theme of the app.</p>

    <h1>Typography</h1>
        <p>Instrument Sans is a free Google font designed by Rodrigo Fuenzalida and Jordan Egstad. It provides a modern, yet readable, look to the text.</p>
